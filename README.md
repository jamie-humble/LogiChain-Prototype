Hello sir, within this directory there are three python scripts
- server.py
  - The main file, to be ran in cmd and accessed by typing localhost:5000 in a browser. 
- supply.py
  - The primary supply chain logic file, mostly houses methods for events and the supply chain
- users.py 
  - Used to construct and save new users to JSON..

I would recommend reading in this order:
- Python
  - users.py
  - supply.py
  - server.py
- JavaScript

As far as accessing the project goes, you have two options:
1. You should try access it through heroku app at https://logichain.herokuapp.com/
2. if not, run server.py in console and connect to the port in aa browser.

Once in, you can follow the how to use documentation on google drive or try playing around with the webapp as its fairly intuitive.
